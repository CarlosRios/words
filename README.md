# Word Spelling Javascript Demo
This is a game I made for my son Nathan. I created it primarily in Javascript, without the use of an MVC library such as React or Vue.

The game was made for 2 reasons. The first was so that Nathan could learn how to spell, since he already knew his numbers and letters. The second reason was to see how much easier it would be for me to build a purely JS built game, without the use of any libraries.
